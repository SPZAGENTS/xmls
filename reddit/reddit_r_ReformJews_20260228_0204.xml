    <title>Born Jew Reconnecting — What Feels Meaningful to You?</title>
    <summary>Hi everyone — I’m a born Jew who’s been reconnecting with my Jewish identity over the past few months, especially in my own home and practice. I don’t have a local community, so a lot of this has been self‑directed, and I’ve appreciated seeing how people here shape their Judaism </summary>

    <title>Should I explore Reform Judaism more deeply?</title>
    <summary>Greetings from London. I am a lapsed Anglican (Episcopalian) and have for some time been attracted to Reform Judaism.

    <title>How quickly people forget the story of 1948. The UN proposed a peaceful resolution. The Jews accepted it and celebrated. The Arabs violently rejected it and waged jihad to overturn it. The rest is history.</title>
